# Problem Statement

The local newspaper and magazine delivery agency has asked us to develop a software for him
to automate various clerical activities associated with his business.

● This software is to be used by the manager of the news agency and his delivery
persons.

● For each delivery person, the system must print each day the publications to be
delivered to each address. The addresses should be generated in consecutive order as
far as possible so that the commutation of the delivery person is minimal.

● Customers usually subscribe one or more news papers and magazines. They are
allowed to change their subscription.

● For each delivery person, the system must print each day the publications to be
delivered to each address. The system should also print for the news agent the
information regarding who received what publications and a summary information of the
current month.

● At the beginning of every month bills are printed by the system to be delivered to the
customers. These bills should be computed by the system automatically and should
include the publication type, the number of copies delivered during the month, and the
cost for these.

● Customers may request to subscribe new newspapers/ magazines, modify their
subscription list, or stop their subscription altogether.

● Customers usually pay their monthly dues either by cheques or cash. Once the cheque
number or cash received is entered in the system, receipt for the customer should be
printed.

● The software should compute and print out the amount payable to each delivery boy.
Each delivery boy gets 2.5% of the value of the publications delivered by him.
